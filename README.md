## Image Steganography: Hide in Plain Sight (Python)

This Python code allows you to hide secret messages within images using steganography! I created it, Jon Barker, as a way to securely embed passwords or small text files within seemingly ordinary images. 

### What is Steganography?

Steganography is the art of hiding information within another medium. In this case, we're concealing messages within images by subtly modifying pixel values. The changes are imperceptible to the naked eye, making it a great way to store sensitive information in plain sight.

###  How it Works

This code takes two main inputs:

1. **Image:** Any image file you want to use as a carrier for your secret message.
2. **Message:** The text you want to hide within the image. This can be a password, a short note, or any other information that fits within the image's capacity.

The code then:

1. Converts your message into a binary format.
2. Modifies the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image pixels to embed the binary message.
3. Creates a new image file with the hidden message embedded.

**Important Note:** This code uses a basic steganographic technique. While it offers some level of obscurity, more sophisticated methods exist for robust message hiding.

### Using the Code

This code is available on GitHub, so you can easily contribute, fork, and improve it! Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine. If you're new to Git, there are plenty of resources online to help you get started. 

2. **Install Dependencies:** 
   This code relies on the `Pillow` library for image manipulation. You can install it using `pip install Pillow` in your terminal.

3. **Run the Script:**
   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and run the script using `python main.py`. The script will prompt you for the image path, message to hide, and starting coordinates (optional).

4. **Decode Your Message:**
   The code currently focuses on embedding messages. Future versions will include a decoding functionality. Stay tuned!

**Note:** Make sure the image format you use supports lossless compression (e.g., PNG) to avoid data corruption during the hiding process.

### Looking Ahead

This is an ongoing project, and I'm excited to develop it further. Here are some potential improvements:

* **Decoding Functionality:** The ability to extract hidden messages from encoded images.
* **Improved Security:** Implementing more robust steganographic techniques for enhanced message concealment.
* **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** A user-friendly interface for easier image and message selection.

Feel free to contribute to the project on GitHub or leave comments with suggestions! Let's make this a powerful tool for secure information storage.
